## soundDENA

soundDENA is a Python library that allows [Denali National Park soundscape scientists](https://www.nps.gov/dena/learn/nature/soundscape.htm) to easily and precisely access their natural sounds data in bulk.
You can read the full documentation at [gjoseph92.github.io/soundDENA/](https://gjoseph92.github.io/soundDENA/).

soundDENA used to be known as soundDB. Though effective, this original version is specific to the Denali file structure. It's been replaced by a new [soundDB](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/soundDB/), which generalizes to all data collected by the [Natural Sounds & Night Skies Division](https://www.nps.gov/orgs/1050/index.htm).

To install `soundDENA`:

`pip install --upgrade --no-deps --index-url https://gjoseph92.github.io/soundDENA/dist/ soundDENA`

soundDENA was written in 2015 by Gabe "Skib" Joseph in Denali National Park & Preserve through the GSA's [GeoCorps program](http://rock.geosociety.org/g_corps/index_gip.htm).
